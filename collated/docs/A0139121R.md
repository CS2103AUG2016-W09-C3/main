<img src="images/model diagram v4.png" width="800"><br>

**API** : [`Model.java`](../src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Task Book data.
* exposes a `UnmodifiableObservableList<ReadOnlyPerson>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list
  so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

### Adding a task: `add`
Format: `add TASK_NAME [d/DATE_TIME de/END_DATE_TIME l/LENGTH] [r/RECUR] [p/PRIORITY] [a/] [i/INFORMATION] [t/TAG]...`

ToDoIt compiles your tasks for the day efficiently with a simple line of text. The `add` command adds your tasks to the to do list, allowing you to view them any time you want.

**Options**
> 1. `d/` Date and time: Specifies the start date and time of a task. Please refer to the Date Specifications section for accepted formats.
> 2. `de/` End date and time: Specifies the end date and time of the task. Please refer to the Date Specifications section for the accepted formats. This parameter should not be used in conjunction with `l/`.
```
###### \UserGuide.md
``` md
> 6. `a/` Autoschedule: If flag is specified, the task will be automatically scheduled to a free slot. If a time, date and length is specified, this flag is ignored.
> 7. `i/` Information: Information to be tagged to this task. Put any extra details you want here.
> 8. `t/` Tags: Specifies tags that are tagged to this task. Tags allow you to group tasks logically by assigning them a similar tag.

**Notes**
> * A task can be dated (has time, date, length), or floating. A floating task is one without any specified date, time and length which can be done at a flexible timing.<br> 
> * If a task is dated (d/ option specified) but length is not specified, the duration defaults to 1 hour.<br> 
> * Tasks can have any number of tags (including 0). Simply repeat the t/ option (e.g. `t/work t/school t/CS2103`).

**Example**
> * You have a CS2101 Lecture weekly, starting from 7th Oct at 2pm. However, the lecture is webcasted so you don't always have to attend, thus making it low priority. You simply have to run: <br>
>   `add CS2101 Lecture h/7th Oct 2pm l/2hr r/1w p/low t/got-webcast` <br>
>   This will add a CS2101 Lecture task which recurs every week starting with 2pm on 7th Oct, marks it as low priority and tags it with the `got-webcast` tag.

### Listing tasks : `list`
ToDoIt displays your tasks easily with a simple command. The tasks to list can be customized to your liking simply with a few keywords.<br>
Format: `list [ds/DATE_START] [ds/DATE_END] [s/SORT_BY] [df/DONE_STATUS] [rev/]`

**Options**
> 1. `ds/` Date start: If a start date is specified, program will only display tasks after this date. If the option is used without a specified date, it will use today's date.
> 2. `de/` Date end: If an end date is specified, program will only display tasks before this date. If the option is used without a specified date, , it will use today's date.
> 3. `s/` Sort by: Sorts the tasks in the order specified (`date`, `time`, `alphabetical`, `priority`).
> 4. `df/` Done tasks: If this flag is specified, tasks that are marked done will be shown. The available done flags are "done", "not done" and "all".
> 5. `rev/` Reverse: If this flag is specified, tasks will be listed in reverse order after sorting.

**Notes**
> * For start and end dates, please refer to Date Specifications section for what formats are accepted.
> * Tasks marked done will be hidden by default. To view done tasks, include the df/all or df/done option.

**Example**
> * You want to view all upcoming tasks ordered by date, so you know what needs to be done. <br>
>   `list ds/ s/date`
> * You want to see all the tasks you have completed in the past year, to celebrate what you've done with your life. <br>
>   `list ds/1st Jan 2016 de/ df/done`

### Finding all tasks containing a keyword: `find`
ToDoIt searches and finds the tasks you need, while filtering out the clutter. Keep your mind focused on what is important.<br>
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS] [s/SCOPE]...`

**Options**
> 1. `s/` Scope: If you only want to search a task's specific attribute, specify which attributes you want to search here (`name` : name, `tag` : tag, `information` : information). By default, it searches in all three areas.

**Notes**
> * The search is not case sensitive. e.g `stuff` will match `Stuff`<br> 
> * The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Do stuff` will match `Stuff do`<br> 
> * Only full words will be matched e.g. `Work` will not match `Workout`<br> 
> * Tasks matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).<br>
    e.g. `Stuff` will match `Do stuff`<br>
> * You can specify more than one search scope (`s/name s/information`). All areas specified will be searched.
> * If no search scope parameter is provided, all attributes (name, information, tag) are searched by default

**Example**
> * You remember naming a task `meeting`, and you want to look for it. However, you don't want to bring up unnecessary tasks so you search for task names only. <br>
>   `find meeting s/name`<br>
> * You want to find all tasks that relate to your family. <br>
>   `find brother sister mother father family`
