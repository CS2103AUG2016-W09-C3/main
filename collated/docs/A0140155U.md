## Model

In this section, the usage and design of certain features of model will be discussed.

### The Command Parser

<img src="images/commandparser.png" width="800"><br>

The command parser is a custom utility used for parsing command syntax easily. It can be used to easily 
customize command behaviour for any new commands to be added.

Each command in ToDoIt consists of a command word, followed by a number of values (represented by any string),
followed by a number of params (represented by two strings separated by a slash i.e. `paramName/param value`).

The CommandParser class parses a command string (Note: **without** the command word) and returns a ParsedCommand
object with the following methods:

#### Value related:
* `getValue()`: Gets the first value in the list of values
* `getValueAtIndex(int index)`: Gets the value in the list of values corresponding to the index
* `getAllValues()`: Gets all values as an arraylist of strings
* `getValuesAsString()`: Gets all values as a string (space concatented)
* `hasValue()`: Returns true if the parsed command has at least one value
* `hasValueAtIndex(int index)`: Returns true if the parsed command has a value at the specified index

#### Param related:
* `getParam(String paramName)`: Retrieves the first param (Note: A param can appear multiple times) from the list corresponding to the param name
* `getParamOrDefault(String paramName, String defaultParam)`: Tries to retrieve the first param from the list corresponding to the param name. Returns defaultParam if the param does not exist
* `getAllParams()`: Gets all param names as an arraylist of strings
* `getParamList(String paramName)`: Retrieves all params from the list corresponding to the param name as an arraylist. Returns an empty list if there are no params corrsponding to the param name
* `hasParams(String[] params)`: Returns true if the parsed command contains every param in the array
* `hasUnnecessaryParams(String[] params)`: Takes in an array of regex strings and returns true if every param in the command matches a regex in the provided array. Used mainly to check if the user has provided any unnecessary parameters.

### Undo/Redo command

ToDoIt allows the user to undo and redo commands with `undo` and `redo`.

#### TaskBookState

This is accomplished by storing different states of the taskbook, using `TaskBookState`. `TaskBookState` is a class that is used solely to wrap two variables:

* `state`: A `TaskBook` object that stores the state of the to do list.
* `command`: A string that stores the command that is used to get to this state. This is solely used for displaying purposes.

#### StatesManager

States are stored and managed using the StatesManager class, which offers the following API:

* `saveState(TaskBookState newState)`: Saves the provided `TaskBookState`
* `loadPreviousState()`: Loads and returns the previous `TaskBookState`. Throws an error if there isn't one
* `loadNextState()`: Loads and returns the next `TaskBookState`. Throws an error if there isn't one

The `ModelManager` has a `StatesManager` object, which handles the state of the to do list as it changes. It calls either `loadPreviousState()` or `loadNextState()` and refreshes the to do list with the state's data.

#### State handling

The StateManager has two variables to keep track of states:

* `states`: An arraylist of `TaskBook` state which stores the state.
* `currentState`: An integer to keep track of the current state (the one displayed to the user). It stores the index of the current state in `states`.

The `states` array and the `currentState` always function such that `states[currentState - 1]`, `states[currentState]`, `states[currentState + 1]` always store the previous, current and next state respectively, assuming the states exist.

When the program is started, the ModelManager saves the init state using `saveState` into the array list and the `currentState` is set to 0.

#### Adding a state

When commands are run, a new `TaskBookState` is created and saved onto the stack using `saveState`. The `TaskBookState` stores the new state of the `TaskBook` object, and the command string that was used.

The `currentState` is incremented, so it now points to the new `TaskBookState`.

This is how the `StateManager` might look like after 3 commands, and the contents of the `states` list:

> `add Meeting` <br>
> `done 5` <br>
> `edit 1 i/Due today`

<img src="images/state1.png" width="400"><br>

Index|TaskBookState|Command
-----|----------------|-------
0|[TaskBook 0]|`Initial State`
1|[TaskBook 1]|`add Meeting`
2|[TaskBook 2]|`done 5`
**3**|**[TaskBook 3]**|**`edit 1 i/Due today`**

If a 4th command is run, this is what it would look like:

> `clear`

<img src="images/state2.png" width="400"><br>

Index|TaskBookState|Command
-----|----------------|-------
0|[TaskBook 0]|`Initial State`
1|[TaskBook 1]|`add Meeting`
2|[TaskBook 2]|`done 5`
3|[TaskBook 3]|`edit 1 i/Due today`
**4**|**[TaskBook 4]**|**`clear`**

#### Undoing

When the `undo` command is called, the state before the `currentState` is loaded.

The `ModelManager` calls `loadPreviousState()`, and the StatesManager handles this by decrementing the `currentState`, and returning the state corresponding to the `currentState`.

> `undo`

<img src="images/state3.png" width="400"><br>

Index|TaskBookState|Command
-----|----------------|-------
0|[TaskBook 0]|`Initial State`
1|[TaskBook 1]|`add Meeting`
2|[TaskBook 2]|`done 5`
**3**|**[TaskBook 3]**|**`edit 1 i/Due today`**
4|[TaskBook 4]|`clear`

`return TaskBookState([TaskBook 3], "clear")`

Note that only the `currentState` is updated.

#### Redoing

The `redo` command is similar to `undo`, except `loadNextState()` is called instead. The StatesManager increments the `currentState`, and returns the state corresponding to the `currentState`.

> `redo`

<img src="images/state2.png" width="400"><br>

Index|TaskBookState|Command
-----|----------------|-------
0|[TaskBook 0]|`Initial State`
1|[TaskBook 1]|`add Meeting`
2|[TaskBook 2]|`done 5`
3|[TaskBook 3]|`edit 1 i/Due today`
**4**|**[TaskBook 4]**|**`clear`**

`return TaskBookState([TaskBook 4], "clear")`

It's important to note that `loadPreviousState()` returns the previous state's (3) state, but the current state's (4) command, while `loadNextState()` returns the current state's (4) command and data. This is needed for displaying the command result message.

#### Overwriting

When a new command is run, and a state is saved, but the `currentState` points to a state in the middle of the list, all future states have to be overwritten. 

<img src="images/state3.png" width="400"><br>

Index|TaskBookState|Command
-----|----------------|-------
0|[TaskBook 0]|`Initial State`
1|[TaskBook 1]|`add Meeting`
2|[TaskBook 2]|`done 5`
**3**|**[TaskBook 3]**|**`edit 1 i/Due today`**
4|[TaskBook 4]|`clear`

> `done 7`

<img src="images/state4.png" width="400"><br>

Index|TaskBookState|Command
-----|----------------|-------
0|[TaskBook 0]|`Initial State`
1|[TaskBook 1]|`add Meeting`
2|[TaskBook 2]|`done 5`
3|[TaskBook 3]|`edit 1 i/Due today`
**4**|**[TaskBook 5]**|**`done 7`**

#### Other concerns

Since a copy of the to do list is saved to a state after each command, the amount of memory stored can be quite big. As such, a hard cap of 10 states (`MAX_STATES`) is imposed.

A better solution might be to have custom undos for each command storing only the minimal amount of data needed to undo it, or to use a shallow copied list + copy-on-write system, but due to limited time constraints, we have decided to go with our current solution.

### Mark a task as done : `done`
Hooray! You've just completed a task! Celebrate your accomplishment by marking it as done.<br>
Format: `done INDEX`

**Notes**
> * This marks task at the specified `INDEX` as done. <br>
    The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
    The index **must be a positive integer** `1`, `2`, `3`, ...<br>
> * Marking a task as done will stop it from showing up in any `list` command, unless the `\df` option is used.
 
**Example**
> * You just completed your homework. Simply find your homework task, then run the following command: <br>
>   `find homework`<br> 
    `done 1`

---
  
### Mark a task as undone : `undone`
Thought you were done, but actually there was one little thing that you forgot to do? No worries, we have all been there. Use this simple command to mark done tasks as not done. Do not worry, ToDoIt will not mock you.<br>
Format: `undone INDEX`

**Notes**
> * This marks task at the specified `INDEX` as undone. <br>
    The index refers to the index number shown in the most recent listing.<br>
    The index **must be a positive integer** `1`, `2`, `3`, ...<br>
 
**Example**
> * You accidentally miscounted and marked the wrong task as done. Simply revert it with the following command: <br>
>   `done 3 (mistake)`<br> 
    `undone 3`

---
  
### Undo a command : `undo`
Made a mistake? No worries, ToDoIt is forgiving. Undo your previous commands with this simple command.<br>
Format: `undo`

**Notes**
> * The program can only undo up to the 10 previous commands.

---
  
### Redo a command : `redo`
Made a mistake while undoing your mistake? Redo your `undo` commands with this simple command.<br>
Format: `redo`

---

### Changing filepath : `filepath`
Always on the go? So is ToDoIt. Move your saved files quickly with this command.<br>
Format: `filepath FILEPATH`

**Notes**
> * The saved file refers to an .xml file on your drive that stores saved task data.
> * The `FILEPATH` must be a valid file path on your drive that ends with .xml. Some examples include `file.xml`, `data/file.xml` or `C:/data/file.xml`.
 
**Example**
> * Your current file is stored at data\addressbook.xml. You want to move your saved file from data\addressbook.xml to data\todoit.xml. Simply run the command<br>
>   `filepath data\todoit.xml`

---

### Mark as favorite: `favorite`
In any task, efficiency is key. Save yourself from typing the same command over and over again by creating a command preset.<br>
Format: `favorite DESCRIPTION c/COMMAND`

**Options**
> 1. `c/` Command: The command associated with the preset.

**Notes**
> * The preset will be added to the preset panel on the left side of the screen. Clicking on the preset will run the specified command.
> * The command can be any executable command (e.g. `list`, `add`, `clear`, `undo`).
> * The favorite command can also be used with an integer `INDEX` to select the corresponding favorite preset. This gives the same result as clicking it.

**Example**
> * find yourself constantly having to list only done tasks, so you decide to create a preset for it:<br>
>   `favorite List only done tasks c/list df/done`<br>
> * This adds a new preset named ‘List only done tasks’ to the preset panel. <br>

---
  
### Unfavorite: `unfavorite`
You can’t work with too many saved presets cluttering up the presets panel. Use this command to remove your saved presets.<br>
Format: `unfavorite INDEX`

**Options**
> 1. `c/` Command: The command associated with the preset.

**Notes**
> * This marks task at the specified `INDEX` as undone. <br>
    The index refers to the index number shown on the preset listing.<br>
    The index **must be a positive integer** `1`, `2`, `3`, ...<br>


**Example**
> * Having added the preset previously, you’ve now changed your mind. Assuming the preset is numbered 8, remove it by running the following command:<br>
>   `unfavorite 8`<br>

```
